# RepairRequest - Facilities Management System

## Overview

RepairRequest is a comprehensive full-stack facilities management system built for educational institutions. The application provides a streamlined platform for managing maintenance requests, facility scheduling, and building operations across multiple organizations. It features role-based access control, real-time messaging, photo uploads, and detailed reporting capabilities.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20 with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with Google OAuth 2.0
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions with connect-pg-simple
- **File Uploads**: Multer for handling photo attachments
- **Email Service**: SendGrid for notification emails

### Database Architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 (via Neon serverless)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with TypeScript schema definitions
- **Schema**: Multi-tenant design with organizations, users, requests, and facilities
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for database migrations

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- Google OAuth 2.0 integration with organization-based access control
- Role-based permissions (requester, maintenance, admin, super_admin)
- Session-based authentication with PostgreSQL storage
- Email domain-based organization assignment

### Request Management
- **Facility Requests**: Event scheduling with equipment needs
- **Building Requests**: Maintenance and repair requests
- Photo upload capabilities with multiple file support
- Status tracking (pending, approved, in-progress, completed)
- Priority levels (low, medium, high, urgent)
- Assignment system for maintenance staff

### Multi-tenant Architecture
- Organization-based data isolation
- Super admin role for cross-organization management
- Dynamic branding based on organization
- Building and facility management per organization

### Communication System
- Real-time messaging threads for requests
- Email notifications via SendGrid
- Status update notifications
- Assignment notifications

## Data Flow

1. **Authentication Flow**: User logs in via Google OAuth → Session created → Role-based dashboard access
2. **Request Creation**: User submits request → Photos uploaded → Notifications sent → Request enters workflow
3. **Request Processing**: Admin assigns → Maintenance staff updates → Status tracked → Completion notification
4. **Reporting Flow**: Admin accesses reports → Data aggregated from multiple tables → Charts generated
